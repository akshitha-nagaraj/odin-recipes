        <h4>Description:</h4>
        A flavorful homemade curry for dinner can be just as easy as a grilled cheese or quick stir-fry, and this recipe is perfect proof. Juicy diced chicken thighs are seared until browned, then coated in tomato paste, chili flakes, and aromatic spices and simmered in creamy, nutty, mildly sweet coconut milk. It’s all finished with tender bell pepper, then spooned over steamy basmati rice for soaking up every last drop of curry.
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup basmati rice</li>
            <li>1 unit bell pepper</li>
            <li>10 oz diced chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 unit tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili flakes</li>
            <li>1 unit coconut milk</li>
            <li>1.5 tbsp sour cream</li>
            <li>2 units scallions</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>pepper</li>
            <li>2 tsp cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small pot, combine rice, ¾ cup water (1½ cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. • Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.</li>
            <li>While rice cooks, wash and dry produce. • Core, deseed, and dice bell pepper into 1-inch pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add bell pepper and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until almost tender, 5 minutes. (TIP: If needed, add splashes of water to help pepper soften.) • Add scallion whites and cook until veggies are softened, 2 minutes more. Turn off heat; transfer to a plate. Wash out pan.</li>
            <li>Pat chicken* dry with paper towels and season all over with salt and pepper. • Heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Add chicken; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Reduce heat under pan to medium.</li>
            <li>Add tomato paste, curry powder, and paprika to pan with chicken. Add a pinch of chili flakes if you like things spicy. • Cook, stirring, until chicken is fully coated and spices are fragrant, 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in coconut milk, ¼ cup water, 1 tsp sugar, 1 TBSP butter, and a big pinch of salt. (For 4 servings, use 1⁄3 cup water, 2 tsp sugar, and 2 TBSP butter.) Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Cook until thickened, 2-3 minutes more. TIP: Taste and add more sugar if you like a sweeter curry. Add bell pepper mixture and sour cream; stir to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.</li>
            <li>Fluff rice with a fork and season with salt and pepper; divide between bowls. • Top rice with coconut chicken curry and sprinkle with a pinch of chili flakes if desired. Garnish with scallion greens and serve.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Chicken is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 165º.</em></strong></li>
